# Kyle Peck (Coding Instructor)

Hey, this is the start of my coding portfolio, I love coding and I want to start a career in it. I have been self learning with this for a while now and have taught myself everything from HTML to React over the last 2 year. Now that I am getting into some of the more interesting topics (APIs and JSON) I have developed a real passion for the material

## Background

I went to college for Math Education and taught math for 4 year. During those year I was recruited to teach a low level coding course and the very next year I went to a technical school to become a full time coding instructor. Over 2 year I have completely revamped the coding curriculum and built out everything.
